# Country Picker Project

This is a small Android project built with **Jetpack Compose**.  
The main goal is to demonstrate **simple UI components** used on a **single screen**.

## Whatâ€™s in the project

- Separated UI components:
  - Checkbox with clickable text
  - Custom TextField with placeholder
  - Text + Icon example for country selection
- All components are reusable.
- Everything is on **one screen only**.
- Used **state hoisting** for components to handle events (clicks, checked state, etc.).
